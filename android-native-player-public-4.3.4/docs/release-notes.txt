      SeamlessVideoView in it.

      setUniqueIdentifierEnabled().

Version 4.1.22:

  SDK Changes:

    * Modified the VideoDisplayComponent to no longer call
      MediaPlayer.setDisplay(null) when destroying the playing,
      because we've seen this hang on some devices with some content,
      like Widevine.

  FreeWheel Plugin changes:

    * Changed default submissionTimeout from 3 to 30 seconds.

  HLS Player changes:

    * Modified SeamlessVideoDisplayComponent to turn off the video
      stream for the prebuffering player earlier during
      initialization, because it's an asynchronous call and the call
      to start buffering is synchronous.  Previously, under certain
      loads, the asynchronous call could be delayed and a bit of audio
      from the next video could be heard.

Version 4.1.21:

  IMA Plugin changes:

    * Modified the GoogleIMAVideoAdPlayer to listen for SEEK_TO events
      and suppress reporting progress until playback has progressed at
      lesat 1 second.  This prevents all the accumulated midrolls from
      piling up and being played when slowly scrubbing to the end of a
      video.

    * Fixed issue where the Surface is destroyed between the time that

    * Updated the VisualOn libvossl_OSMP library, which includes an
      update to the OpenSSL library from version 0.9.8m to version
      0.9.8za.  The VisualOn 3.11.26 update in version 4.1.17
      unknowingly reverted the previous libvossl_OSMP library update.

    * Modified setClosedCaptionsEnabled() to enable/disable closed
      captioning for the current playing video.

  Widevine Plugin changes:

    * Added uniqueId, type, and message properties to DRM events.

Version 4.1.19:

  IMA Plugin changes:

    * Fixed issue where when starting playback from a non-zero
      position, playback would skip back to that non-zero position
      after the first ad finished.  This was a side effect of the fix
      in 4.1.18.

Version 4.1.18:

  IMA Plugin changes:

    * Fixed hang caused by ad responses without any valid ads when
      using Ad Rules.

Version 4.1.15:

  SDK changes:

    * Removed recently added MediaPlayer.reset() call from
      VideoDisplayComponent's destroyPlayer(), because it causes ANR
      hangs with some devices and some content.

  IMA Plugin changes:

    * Fixed issue where the onResume() callback was called instead
      onPlay() when ads began playback.

  OnceUx Plugin changes:

    * Deprecated the two URI processVideo() method in favor of a
      single URI interface.

    * Added initial support for companion ads.

  HLS Player changes:

    * Updated the VisualOn libvossl_OSMP library, which includes an
      update to the OpenSSL library from version 0.9.8m to version
      0.9.8za.

    * The .aar file now has the .so files in the jni/armeabi folder
      instead of in the armeabi.jar, which was a workaround and
      support for the workaroudn was recently removed from the Android
      Gradle Build Tools.

    * Updated to emit DID_INTERRUPT_CONTENT and DID_RESUME_CONTENT.

Version 4.1.14:

  SDK changes:

    * Added VERSION event.

      WILL_INTERRUPT_CONTENT and WILL_RESUME_CONTENT event listeners
      complete.

    * Added getEventLogger() to the BrightcovePlayer class.

  IMA Plugin changes:

    * Fixed issue with extra PAUSE and RESUME tracking events at the
      beginning of each ad break.

    * Fixed issue with video auto playing when the Ad Rules URL failed
      to load.
