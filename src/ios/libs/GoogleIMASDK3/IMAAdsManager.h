//  Declares IMAAdsManager interface that manages ad playback.
//  The interface represents an abstract API. There can be one or more ads
//  managed by a single ads manager.
//  The implementing code should respond to the callbacks as defined in
//  IMAAdsManagerDelegate.
//
//  A typical ad playback session:
//    1. Ads manager is retrieved. Delegate is set.
//    2. [adsManager initialize...];  - ad is initialized and loads.
//    3. delegate.didReceiveAdEvent is called with a kIMAAdEventLoaded event.
//    4. [adsManager start];
//    5. delegate.adsManagerDidRequestContentPause: is called. The content
//       playback should pause now.
//    6. Ad display container master view is unhidden and playback starts.
//    7. delegate.didReceiveAdEvent is called with ad events.
//    8. Ad finishes.
//    9. delegate.adsManagerDidRequestContentResume: is called. The content
//       playback should resume now.
//    10. delegate.didReceiveAdEvent: is called with the
//        kIMAAdEvent_ALL_ADS_COMPLETED event.
//        It is possible to detach the delegate and destroy the ads manager.
//
//  If multiple ads are managed by the ads manager, steps 5-9 may repeat several
//  times. Step 5 will happen at times predetermined by the ads server.
//  The implementing code should listen to callbacks until
//  kIMAAdEvent_ALL_ADS_COMPLETED is received.
